Abandoned fb driver for VIA Unichrome devices.

This was written during the first phase of absolute disillusionment with 
X.org, as after years of being the only person driving the topic of 
modesetting forwards, getting either ignored, being told off, or even 
forked away from, people were now preaching modesetting everywhere, and 
conveniently forgetting where it all stemmed from.

It was abandoned in april 2007, as Egbert Eich, one of the few remaining 
display driver developers of the Xfree86 days, started the process of 
hiring me into SuSE Linux, and i had to juggle this process with 
finishing a college degree. And as soon as i joined SuSE, we freed ATI, 
and almost everything unichrome went on ice for nearly 2 years.
